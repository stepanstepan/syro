# Syro: A Generative and Modular Music Sequencer

Syro is a generative and modular music sequencer written with Flutter and Dart. It provides a platform for creating and experimenting with various music sequences, patterns, and arrangements using an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

## Features

Some of the key features of Syro include:

- A modular architecture that allows for creating, connecting, and combining different sequencer components, such as step sequencers, arpeggiators, and LFOs.
- Multiple sound engines for generating different types of sounds, such as drums, synths, and samplers, with customizable parameters and effects.
- A live mode for playing and improvising with the sequences, using a MIDI controller or a computer keyboard.
- A recording feature for capturing the performance and exporting it as an audio file.

## Installation

To install Syro, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd syro
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will launch the Syro app on your device or emulator.

## Usage

Once you launch Syro, you can start creating your own sequences by selecting and connecting different sequencer components. You can adjust the parameters of each component and add effects to shape the sound. You can also create and save presets for your favorite sequences.

In the live mode, you can play and improvise with the sequences using a MIDI controller or a computer keyboard. You can also record your performance and export it as an audio file.
